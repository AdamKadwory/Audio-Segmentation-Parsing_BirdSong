# Audio-Segmentation-Parsing_BirdSong

This repository contains code intended to locate and segment out periods of vocalization 
within hours-long recordings and exclude undesired intervals (noisy periods / long silences). 
It contains methods and models to automatically label syllables in the segmented periods of vocalization. 
It also contains scripts to produce reporting summaries of daily recording results.
